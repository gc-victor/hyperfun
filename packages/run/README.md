# hyperfun run

Template agnostic package to create unidirectional user interface architecture.

## Install

You can use npm or yarn to install it.

`$ npm install --save @hyperfun/run`

`$ yarn add @hyperfun/run`

## Run

Initialize the application.

```run({ view, render, state, plugins })```

### API

- view: DOM/VDom tree to attach to the DOM. It will receive as an argument the new state
- render: Has being designed render your template. It will receive as argument the new view, and after the first render the options defined in the update as a second argument
- state: definition of the initial store
- plugins: list of middlewares that could be used to change the render, state or view definitions
    - subscriptions: will be executed once after the first render of the view
    - willUpdate: will be executed on each update and is invoked immediately before rendering. Can be used to mutate the state

### Example

```
import { run } from '@hyperfun/run';
import { div, h1, patch } from '@hyperfun/dom';
import { localStorage, logs } from './plugins';

/* State */

const state = {};

/* View */

const view = () => div('#app', [h1(['Bye, bey!'])])

/* Render */

const render = (node, options = {}) =>
    patch(document.getElementById('app'), node);

run({
    view,
    render,
    state,
    plugins: [localStorage, logs],
});
```

## Update

Updates the global store.

```
update({
   type: 'TYPE_NAME',
   payload: state => ({ ...state, text: 'Hello world!' }),
   options: {
        element: () => document.querySelector('.js-selector'),
        view: ({ text }) => h1('.js-selector', [text]),
    },
})
```

### API

- type: indicates the type of action being performed (required),
- payload: sends data from the update to the store (required),
- options (none required)
    - element: DOM element where the view is going to be attached
    - view: component/element to be attached to the DOM

### Example

```
import { run, update } from '@hyperfun/run';
import { button, h1, p } from '@hyperfun/dom';

/* State */

const state = {};

/* View */

const helloWorld = () =>
    update({
        type: 'HELLO_WORLD',
        payload: state => ({ hello: 'world' }),
        options: {
             element: () => document.querySelector('.js-helloWorld'),
             view: () => h1('.js-helloWorld', ['Hello world!']),
         },
    });

const view = () => div('#app', [
    h1('.js-helloWorld', ['Bye bey!']),
    p([
        button({ onClick: helloWorld }, ['Add hello world'])
    ])
])

/* Render */

const render = (node: Function, options: RenderOptions = {}) =>
    patch(options.element ? options.element() : document.getElementById('app'), node);

/* Run */

run({
    view,
    render,
    state,
    plugins,
});
```

## Connect

It will inject into the component any new update of the state.

```
connect([mapStateToProps])(component)
```

### API

- mapStateToProps: map new state changes with properties
- component: component to be executed on every state update

### Example 

```
import { connect, run, update } from '@hyperfun/run';
import { button, h1, p } from '@hyperfun/dom';

/* State */

const state = {};

/* View */

const helloWorld = () =>
    update({
        type: 'HELLO_WORLD',
        payload: state => ({ hello: 'world' }),
        options: {
             element: () => document.querySelector('.js-helloWorld'),
             view: () => h1('.js-helloWorld', ['Hello world!']),
         },
    });

const helloWorldView = ({ hello, state }) => div('#app', [
    h1('.js-helloWorld', ['Bye bey!']),
    p([
        button({ onClick: helloWorld }, ['Add hello world'])
    ])
])

const view = (): any =>
    div('#app', [
        connect(state => ({ hello: 'world', state }))(helloWorldView)
    ]);

/* Render */

const render = (node: Function, options: RenderOptions = {}) =>
    patch(options.element ? options.element() : document.getElementById('app'), node);

/* Run */

run({
    view,
    render,
    state,
    plugins,
});
```
